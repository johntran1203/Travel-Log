            Joshua Tree National Park is a vast protected area in southern

            desert landscapes. Named for the regionâ€™s twisted, bristled Joshua
            trees, the park straddles the cactus-dotted Colorado Desert and the
            Mojave Desert, which is higher and cooler. Keys View looks out over
            the Coachella Valley. Hiking trails weave through the boulders of
            Hidden Valley

            once. Lines are long but worth it for some people. Disneyland is a
            theme park in Anaheim, California. Opened in 1955, it was the first
            theme park opened by the The Walt Disney Company and the only one
            designed and constructed under the direct supervision of Walt
            Disney.
